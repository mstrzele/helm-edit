## helm verify

verify that a chart at the given path has been signed and is valid

### Synopsis


Verify that the given chart has a valid provenance file.

Provenance files provide cryptographic verification that a chart has not been
tampered with, and was packaged by a trusted provider.

This command can be used to verify a local chart. Several other commands provide
'--verify' flags that run the same validation. To generate a signed package, use
the 'helm package --sign' command.
